# Project Pass-Off Instructions

\[Option 1\]

Once you finish your project and feel good about it, here are the steps to take to pass off:

1.  Put all your .cpp and .h files into a .zip file. Note that these are the only files you need.
    -   Make sure the files in your .zip are NOT within a subdirectory. The pass-off driver is not smart enough to find any .cpp's or .h's in subdirectories.
    -   You may have to hold CTRL while selecting each file and then zip them up to do this.
2.  Submit the .zip on Learning Suite under the project you want to pass off.
3.  Go to [http://cs236.cs.byu.edu/](http://cs236.cs.byu.edu/) and fill out all necessary fields

Everyone should have just received a submission password for the class pass-off website [http://cs236.cs.byu.edu/](http://cs236.cs.byu.edu/). Reach out to the head TA on slack if you did not receive one and would like one.

\[Option 2\]

Once you finish your project and feel good about it, here are the steps to take to pass off:

1.  Put all your .cpp and .h files into a .zip file. Note that these are the only files you need.
    - Make sure the files in your .zip are NOT within a subdirectory. The pass off driver is not smart enough to find any .cpp's or .h's in subdirectories.
    - You may have to hold CTRL while selecting each file and then zip them up to do this.
    - If you have the makefile set up you can create this by simply running the command "make zip" 
2.  Submit the .zip on Learning Suite under the project you want to pass off.
3.  Get in the Help Queue, making sure the "Pass Off" box is checked.

Once you meet with a TA, they will download your .zip file from Learning Suite and run it through the pass off driver. This driver runs test cases almost identical to the ones given under the project's "Project (project #) pass-off cases" Learning Suite page, doing so on the CS lab machines. It will then show which test cases passed/failed and show what caused the failing cases to do so.

It is expected that you re-enter the queue each time you wish to pass off your project, as this will make things faster for everyone behind you. Feel free to hop back in the queue for help if you need to.

Tips:

- Testing your code as outlined on []()
    - The "Project 0 -- Tutorials" page is a good start for guidance on how to access the lab machines and transfer your projects there.
- On days that projects are due, those passing off will have priority over other people in the Help Queue. This means that the position in line that the Queue will tell you is probably incorrect and you may be helped sooner than you think. This also means that on pass off days, getting other help will most likely be faster over Slack.
