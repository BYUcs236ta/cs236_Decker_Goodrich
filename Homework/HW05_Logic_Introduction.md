# HW05_Logic_Introduction

### Symbol Reference
- $\lnot$ logical not (sometimes written as !)
- $\lor$ logical or
- $\land$ logical and
- $\rightarrow$ implication (if A then B)
- $\leftrightarrow$ biconditional (if and only if)

### Question 1

Using the Symbols:
- R for "Mark is rich"
- M for "Mark is happy"

Re-write the following statements in symbolic form (using only the symbols from the reference section):

>a. Mark is not rich.
>
>b. Mark is rich and happy.
>
>c. Mark is rich or happy.
>
>d. If Mark is rich, then he is happy.

### Question 2

Identify the atomic propositions of the following sentences and replace them by propositional symbols. Then translate the sentences into propositional calculus.

Example:
`If you leave, the house will be quiet`

First assign each clause a propositional symbol then write each of the following phrases in symbolic form:
- “L = you leave” 
- “Q = house is quiet”

Then re-write as: 
L -> Q

a. If you do not leave, I will call the police. 

b. I am sad if and only if I am not happy. 

c. It is a nice day if it is sunny and it is not hot.

### Question 3
Given the following:
```
P is true
Q is true
R is false
S is false
```

Find the truth value of the each of the following (Hint: substitute then solve):

 a. 
 
 $$(\lnot (P \land Q) \lor \lnot R) \lor ((Q \leftrightarrow \lnot P) \rightarrow (R \lor \lnot S))$$

 b. 

 $$(P \leftrightarrow R) \land (\lnot Q \rightarrow S)$$ 

c. 

$$ (P \lor (Q \rightarrow (R \land \lnot P))) \leftrightarrow (Q \lor \lnot S) $$
