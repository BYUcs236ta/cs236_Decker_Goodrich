# HW19_Depth_First_Search_Forest
---
### Question 1
For the graph G below, create the depth-first search forest that starts with node A. Whenever there is a choice of which node to visit next, choose the node that comes alphabetically first. Use solid arrows for tree edges. Add all “missing edges” as dashed edges. Label all edges as tree, forward, backward, or cross edges. Add post-order numbers as subscripts to each node name.
